      "Scientists in the United Kingdom said they have achieved a new milestone in producing nuclear fusion energy, or imitating the way energy is produced in the Sun. Energy by nuclear fusion is one of mankindâ€™s long standing quests as it promises to be low carbon, safer than how nuclear energy is now produced and, with an efficiency that can technically exceed a 100%.\n",

A kg of fusion fuel contains about 10 million times as much energy as a kg of coal, oil or gas.\n"
